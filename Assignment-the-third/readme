Demultiplex (demux.py)

Uses libraries: gzip, re, argparse, matplotlib, os

Script does the following in this order:

    1. Takes in 5 fastq.gz files in this order: Read 1, Index 1, Index 2, Read 2, Index List
    2. Reads all 5 files line by line, pulling out records
    3. Reverse compliments Index 2
    4. Attempts to repair up to 2 "N" reads in both indexes using its pair as a reference
            - Does nothing if more than 2 N's exist (meaning the read quality is too low)
            - Does nothing if both indexes contain N at the same position (Example: ATCNG -> ATCNG) = goes to unknown
    5. If any N's remain after repair, it sends both associated reads to "R1_unknown.fq.gz" and "R2_unknown.fq.gz", respectively.
    6. If indexes are valid and matching pair - sends the record to the appropriate matched file
    7. If indexes are valid but not matching - sends record to the appropriate hopped file
    8. If indexes are not valid - sends to unknown
    9. Once all records have been distributed, move to gather stats
    11. Creates bar plot for each category
    12. Creates pie chart of same category

Run with 'python demux.py -i dir/R1.fq.gz dir/I1.fq.gz dir/I2.fq.gz dir/R2.fq.gz dir/index.txt'

Output Example: 
OUT/R1_ATGC.fq.gz
OUT/R2_ATGC.fq.gz
OUT/R1_hopped.fq.gz
OUT/R2_hopped.fq.gz
OUT/R1_unknown.fq.gz
OUT/R2_unknown.fq.gz
